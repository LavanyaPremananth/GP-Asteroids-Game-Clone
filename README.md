# Asteroids Game Clone with Realistic Movement and Score System

The **Asteroids Game Clone** project is a space-themed game implemented using p5.js, featuring realistic movement, gravity simulation, collision checks, and additional gameplay elements like jet thrusters and a score system.

## Project Overview

In this Asteroids game clone, the primary goal is to navigate a spaceship through a field of asteroids while avoiding collisions and scoring points by hitting the asteroids. Key features of the game include:

- **Spaceship Controls**:
  - Use arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) to control the spaceship's movement.
  - Press the spacebar to activate the spaceship's firing mechanism to shoot bullets.

- **Asteroid System**:
  - Simulates multiple asteroids moving and interacting with the spaceship.
  - Detects collisions between the spaceship and asteroids, triggering game events.

- **Jet Thrusters**:
  - Activates jet thrusters on the opposite side of spaceship movement to simulate realistic physics.

- **Score System**:
  - Keeps track of the number of asteroids hit by the spaceship.
  - Displays the game score on the screen.

- **Game Over Mechanism**:
  - Ends the game upon certain conditions, such as collision with Earth, atmosphere, or running out of time.

## Development Details

The game leverages the following concepts and techniques:

- **Physics Simulation**:
  - Implements basic physics interactions using vector operations for movement and collision detection.

- **User Interaction**:
  - Responds to keyboard inputs for controlling the spaceship's movement and firing bullets.

- **Game State Management**:
  - Manages game state transitions, such as game over conditions, to control the game's flow.

- **Visual Feedback**:
  - Provides visual feedback through graphical elements like asteroids, spaceship, bullets, and game score display.

## Gameplay Instructions

1. **Controls**:
   - Use arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) to move the spaceship.
   - Press the spacebar to shoot bullets from the spaceship.

2. **Objective**:
   - Navigate the spaceship to avoid collisions with Earth and asteroids.
   - Hit asteroids with bullets to increase the game score.
   - Survive as long as possible without colliding to achieve a higher score.

## Conclusion

The Asteroids Game Clone project delivers an engaging gameplay experience with dynamic space physics and interactive elements. Players can enjoy maneuvering the spaceship, shooting asteroids, and competing for the highest score within the game's constraints.

For further enhancements, I will consider adding more gameplay features, improving visual effects, or implementing additional game mechanics to enhance user engagement.
